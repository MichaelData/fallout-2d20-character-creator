"Greetings, Wastelander. You hold in your hands a relic of the Old World, 
repurposed for the harsh realities of the New. Whether you are a Vault Dweller 
stepping into the light for the first time, or a scarred NCR Ranger, 
this tool will document your journey.

Don't lose your head out there. And if you do... well, at least your 
inventory will be well-organized."

## 📝 Overview
This is a standalone, offline **HTML5 Character Creator & Manager** for the *Fallout: The Roleplaying Game* (2d20 System). It is designed to run in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) without an internet connection.

It handles everything from **Character Creation** (Origins, S.P.E.C.I.A.L., Skills) to **Active Play** (Health, Radiation, Ammo tracking, Inventory).

## ✨ Features

### 1. Character Builder
*   **Full Origin Database:** Includes all major Origins (Survivor, Brotherhood, Super Mutant, Ghoul, Synth, Mister Handy, etc.) with automatic stat adjustments (e.g., Super Mutants get STR/END limits set to 12).
*   **Trait Logic:** Automatically populates the correct Traits based on your Origin (NCR, Tribal, Survivor lists).
*   **Perk Selection:** Complete database of perks with requirement checks (Level, S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats).
*   **Skill Tagging:** Checking a "Tag" box automatically calculates your +2 Skill Rank bonus.

### 2. The Weapon Fabricator
*   **Database:** Pre-loaded with **115+ weapons** from the wasteland (Small Guns, Energy, Big Guns, Melee, Explosives).
*   **Customization:** Select a preset (e.g., "10mm Pistol") and modify it, or create a completely custom "Homebrew" weapon from scratch.
*   **Ammo Tracking:** Track Mag capacity vs. Ammo Pool directly on the sheet.

### 3. Manager Mode (Active Play)
*   **Health & Resistances:** Calculates Max HP, Defense, and Carry Weight based on your stats.
*   **Inventory:** Text area for general gear, caps, and armor.
*   **XP & Leveling:** Track XP and force level-ups.

### 4. Holotape Save System
*   **Save Data:** Exports your character as a `.json` file to backup your progress.
*   **Save Text:** Exports a readable `.txt` summary of your sheet.
*   **Terminal Animation:** Features a retro RobCo terminal boot-up sequence when saving.
*   **Load:** Restore your character instantly by uploading your `.json` backup.

### 5. Visual Themes
*   **Pip-Boy Mode:** High contrast Green-on-Black CRT aesthetic.
*   **Paper Mode:** Printer-friendly layout for physical sessions.

## 🚀 How to Install
1.  Download the `.html` file.
2.  **That's it.** There is no installation.
3.  Double-click the file to open it in your web browser.

## 🕹️ Controls
*   **Hover:** Hover over perks to see requirements and descriptions.
*   **Click:** Click "Tag" boxes to add tag skills.
*   **Toggle:** Use the "Toggle View" button to switch between Pip-Boy and Paper themes.
*   **Print:** Click "Save as PDF / Print" to generate a clean sheet for physical play (automatically hides the buttons and builder tools).

## ⚠️ Notes from The Archivist
*   **Super Mutants:** Remember, your Strength and Endurance bases are higher. The system handles this, but remember you cannot lower them below your racial minimum.
*   **Browser Storage:** This tool runs locally. If you close the browser without clicking "Export Save Data," your progress is lost to the radiation. **SAVE OFTEN.**
